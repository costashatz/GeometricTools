###Library for Linear Algebra and Numerical Analysis Algorithms

####Needs C++11 compatible compiler to compile!

####So far I have implemented:

1. Generic Templated Class for Matrices
    * Supports any dimension and many properties (many need to be added and some to improve)
    * Supports Strassen's algorithm for fast matrix-matrix multiplications (needs improvement)
2. Generic Templated Class for Vectors
    * Supports any dimension and most of the vector properties (cross product need to be added)
3. Solve Linear Systems
    * Using Gauss Elimination
    * Using LU Decomposition
4. Decompositions
    * LU Decomposition

####Planning to implement:

1. Improve the templated classes for Matrices and Vectors
    * Eigen-values and eigen-vectors computation
    * Cleanify code/add comments
    * ...general imporvement (e.g. write Strassen's algorithm using my classes)
2. Improve code for Matrix Algorithms file
3. Add more linear systems solving mechanisms (algorithms)
4. Add more decomposition techniques (e.g. SVD)


####WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY

I am currently working on this little library/project and will be pushing more updated stuff. Any suggestions of course are more than welcomed.
