###Math Library for Linear Algebra, Numerical Analysis and Collision Detection Algorithms

####Needs C++11 compatible compiler to compile!

####So far I have implemented:

1. Generic Templated Class for Matrices
    * Supports any dimension and many properties (many need to be added and some to improve)
    * Supports Strassen's algorithm for fast matrix-matrix multiplications (needs improvement)
2. Generic Templated Class for Vectors
    * Supports any dimension and most of the vector properties (cross product need to be added)
3. Solve Linear Systems
    * Using Gauss Elimination
    * Using LU Decomposition
4. Decompositions
    * LU Decomposition

####Planning to implement:

1. Improve the templated classes for Matrices and Vectors
    * Eigen-values and eigen-vectors computation
    * Cleanify code/add comments
    * ...general imporvement (e.g. write Strassen's algorithm using my classes)
2. Add more linear systems solving mechanisms (algorithms)
3. Add more decomposition techniques (e.g. SVD)


####WORK IN PROGRESS - WILL BE UPDATED FREQUENTLY

I am currently working on this little library/project and will be pushing more updated stuff. Any suggestions of course are more than welcomed.
